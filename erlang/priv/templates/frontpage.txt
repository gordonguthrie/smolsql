#  üíª Welcome to the Smol DB Server
This server implements a tiny subset of SQL and stores all data in human readable files.
=> https://github.com/gordonguthrie/smolsql read more

## üè¶ Databases
~format_dbs_fn~;
=> /dbs/create create a new database

## ‚å®Ô∏è Configurations
This server is configured to only accept connections from one of these users:
~format_admins_fn~;

## üéõ How It Works
To execute SQL send a request to:
```
/db/<dbname>
```
on the 10 response post back the sql as query parameters
```
sql=sql statement
```
Databases are created on first-write

Tables are created by posting a table definition to
```
/db/<dbmame>/create?def=<table definition>
```
The table definition takes the form of a list of of tuples, each tuple is a pair:
```
{<columnname>, <type>}
```
The columnname can be any text (you can use quotes) and the type must be one of:
```
int
float
varchar
date
autoindex
```

## üèÅThe SQL That Is Supported

```
INSERT INTO table VALUES (val1, val2, val3);
INSERT INTO table (col1, col2, col3...) VALUES (val1, val2, val3...);
SELECT * FROM table;
SELECT col1, col2, col3... FROM table;
SELECT [* | col1, col2, col3, col4...] FROM table WHERE (col1='alice' AND col2='bob'( OR (col3='charlie' AND col4 [=, <, >, =<. >=] 3);
SELECT [* | col1, col2, col3] FROM table1 INNER JOIN table2 ON table1.col1 = table2.col2 WHERE...;
DELETE FROM table WHERE ...;
```
