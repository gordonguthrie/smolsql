## ðŸ—„ Create A Table

=> /dbs/~db~;/create/~table~; create a table

## ðŸŽ“ Tutorial

Here is an example of table creation:

```
autoindex: primarykey
firstname: varchar
lastname:  varchar
age:       integer
height:    float
dob:       date
is_member: boolean
```

Here is another:

```
index:     email
email:     varchar
firstname: varchar
lastname:  varchar
age:       integer
height:    float
dob:       date
is_member: boolean
```

The table declaration consists of two parts:
* how it will be indexed
* a list of fields

The index options are:
```
autoindex: <colname>
```
and
```
index: <colname>
```

In the former case you don't need to declare the column anywhere it will be automatically created and on making a new record each one will get an incrementing integer.

In the latter case the index column is used to generate an index as a hash - if you wish to use the data supplied for the index (in this case an email address) you need to define a column with the same name.

Conventionally the indexes are declared at the top, but they don't have to be.
